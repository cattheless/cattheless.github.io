Every year on the first of February, artists the internet over like to waste their entire day documenting their activities through hourly comics, therefore making their activities less interesting to document. It's a lot of fun, though, so I've been attempting it the past few years.


I was successful this year! But didn't finish coloring them yet. So here's what I've got and hopefully I'll color 'em and scan them in properly eventually (mom life, y'know).
